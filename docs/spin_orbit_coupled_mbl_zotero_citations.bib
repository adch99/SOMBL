  abstract = {We report a numerical investigation of the Anderson transition in two-dimensional systems with spin-orbit coupling. An accurate estimate of the critical exponent ν for the divergence of the localization length in this universality class has to our knowledge not been reported in the literature. Here we analyze the SU(2) model. We find that for this model corrections to scaling due to irrelevant scaling variables may be neglected permitting an accurate estimate of the exponent ν=2.73±0.02.},

  abstract = {We study the dynamics of one- and two-dimensional disordered lattice bosons/fermions initialized to a Fock state with 1 particle on a set of lattice sites (A) and 0 particles on the rest of the sites (¯¯¯A). Such states have been considered in recent ultracold atomic experiments to detect many body localization. For noninteracting systems we establish a universal relation between the long time density imbalance between A and ¯¯¯A sites, I(∞), the localization length ξl, and the geometry of the initial pattern. For the alternating initial pattern of 1 and 0 particles in one dimension, I(∞)=tanh[a/ξl], where a is the lattice spacing. For systems with mobility edge, we find analytic relations between I(∞), the effective localization length ¯ξl, and the fraction of localized states fl. The imbalance as a function of disorder shows nonanalytic behavior when the mobility edge passes through a band edge. For interacting bosonic systems, we show that there is a mechanism to retain a finite long-time imbalance in the system even in presence of dissipative and stochastic processes coming from interparticle scattering. The scattering of particles, which lead to a decay of the memory of initial conditions through dissipative processes, also creates excitations in the system. For strong disorder, the excitations act as a local bath, whose noise correlators retain information of the initial pattern. This sustains a finite imbalance at long times in strongly disordered interacting systems.},

The term “Anderson transition” is understood in a broad sense, including both metal-insulator transitions and quantum-Hall-type transitions between phases with localized states. The emphasis is put on recent developments, which include multifractality of critical wave functions, criticality in the power-law random banded matrix model, symmetry classification of disordered electronic systems, mechanisms of criticality in quasi-one-dimensional and two-dimensional systems and survey of corresponding critical theories, network models, and random Dirac Hamiltonians. Analytical approaches are complemented by advanced numerical simulations.},

  abstract = {Competition between superconductivity and disorder plays an essential role in understanding the metal-insulator transition. Based on the Bogoliubov-de Gennes framework, we studied an 2D s-wave fermionic optical lattice system with both spin- orbit coupling and disorder are presented. We find that, with the increase of the strength of disorder, the mean superconducting order parameter will vanish while the energy gap will persist, which indicates that the system undergoes a transition from a superconducting state to a gapped insulating state. This can be confirmed by calculating the inverse participation ratio. We also find that, if the strength of disorder is small, the superconducting order parameter and the energy gap will decrease if we increase the strength of spin-orbit coupling and Zeeman field. In the large disorder limits, the increase of the strength of spin- orbit coupling will increase the mean superconducting order parameter. This phenomenon shows that the system is more insensitive to disorder if the spin-orbit coupling is presented. Numerical computing also shows that the whole system breaks up into several superconducting islands instead of being superconductive.},

The computer storage requirements of the procedure are independent of the length of the system, the maximum system length treatable being only limited by the computer time available. First results obtained for a system containing up to 108 sites indicate that the DC conductivity obeys the central limit theorem. It vanishes in the limit of zero temperature and fulfils a scaling law.},

We show that the mobility edge depends strongly on the mixing angle between Rashba and Dresselhaus spin-orbit couplings. For equal couplings a non-power-law divergence is found, signaling the crossing to the orthogonal class, where such a 2D transition is forbidden.},

Using multiple statistical measures like gap statistics and extremal entanglement spectrum distributions, we find the phase diagram in the disorder-correlation plane, where the transition happens at progressively larger values of the correlation with increasing values of disorder. We then show that one can use the average of sample variance of magnetic fields as a single parameter which encodes the effects of the correlated disorder. The distributions and averages of various statistics collapse into a single curve as a function of this parameter. This also allows us to analytically calculate the phase diagram in the disorder-correlation plane.},
