  abstract = {Effects of symmetry on localization on two-dimensional square lattices are studied numerically. The inverse localization length is determined by the system-size dependence of the Thouless number in magnetic fields or in the presence of strong spin-orbit interactions. A finite-size-scaling method is also applied to the case of spin-orbit interactions. Extended states, present in each Landau level in strong magnetic fields or in the case of small randomness, are found to merge together with increasing randomness and disappear beyond a certain critical randomness. In weak magnetic fields, the field tends to reduce the localization near the band center, while the localization is enhanced in the band-tail region. Spin-orbit interactions cause effects similar to, but much stronger than, that due to a weak magnetic field. The critical randomness and exponent for a metal-insulator transition are determined in the presence of strong spin-orbit interactions.},

  abstract = {Racetrack memory (RTM) is a novel spintronic memory-storage technology that has the potential to overcome fundamental constraints of existing memory and storage devices. It is unique in that its core differentiating feature is the movement of data, which is composed of magnetic domain walls (DWs), by short current pulses. This enables more data to be stored per unit area compared to any other current technologies. On the one hand, RTM has the potential for mass data storage with unlimited endurance using considerably less energy than today’s technologies. On the other hand, RTM promises an ultrafast nonvolatile memory competitive with static random access memory (SRAM) but with a much smaller footprint. During the last decade, the discovery of novel physical mechanisms to operate RTM has led to a major enhancement in the efficiency with which nanoscopic, chiral DWs can be manipulated. New materials and artificially atomically engineered thin-film structures have been found to increase the speed and lower the threshold current with which the data bits can be manipulated. With these recent developments, RTM has attracted the attention of the computer architecture community that has evaluated the use of RTM at various levels in the memory stack. Recent studies advocate RTM as a promising compromise between, on the one hand, power-hungry, volatile memories and, on the other hand, slow, nonvolatile storage. By optimizing the memory subsystem, significant performance improvements can be achieved, enabling a new era of cache, graphical processing units, and high capacity memory devices. In this article, we provide an overview of the major developments of RTM technology from both the physics and computer architecture perspectives over the past decade. We identify the remaining challenges and give an outlook on its future.},

  abstract = {We study the dynamics of one- and two-dimensional disordered lattice bosons/fermions initialized to a Fock state with 1 particle on a set of lattice sites (A) and 0 particles on the rest of the sites (¯¯¯A). Such states have been considered in recent ultracold atomic experiments to detect many body localization. For noninteracting systems we establish a universal relation between the long time density imbalance between A and ¯¯¯A sites, I(∞), the localization length ξl, and the geometry of the initial pattern. For the alternating initial pattern of 1 and 0 particles in one dimension, I(∞)=tanh[a/ξl], where a is the lattice spacing. For systems with mobility edge, we find analytic relations between I(∞), the effective localization length ¯ξl, and the fraction of localized states fl. The imbalance as a function of disorder shows nonanalytic behavior when the mobility edge passes through a band edge. For interacting bosonic systems, we show that there is a mechanism to retain a finite long-time imbalance in the system even in presence of dissipative and stochastic processes coming from interparticle scattering. The scattering of particles, which lead to a decay of the memory of initial conditions through dissipative processes, also creates excitations in the system. For strong disorder, the excitations act as a local bath, whose noise correlators retain information of the initial pattern. This sustains a finite imbalance at long times in strongly disordered interacting systems.},

  abstract = {Schwinger Keldysh field theory is a widely used paradigm to study non-equilibrium dynamics of quantum many-body systems starting from a thermal state. We extend this formalism to describe non-equilibrium dynamics of quantum systems starting from arbitrary initial many-body density matrices. We show how this can be done for both Bosons and Fermions, and for both closed and open quantum systems, using additional sources coupled to bilinears of the fields at the initial time, calculating Green's functions in a theory with these sources, and then taking appropriate set of derivatives of these Green's functions w.r.t. initial sources to obtain physical observables. The set of derivatives depend on the initial density matrix. The physical correlators in a dynamics with arbitrary initial conditions do not satisfy Wick's theorem, even for non-interacting systems. However our formalism constructs intermediate ``n-particle Green's functions'' which obey Wick's theorem and provide a prescription to obtain physical correlation functions from them. This allows us to obtain analytic answers for all physical many body correlation functions of a non-interacting system even when it is initialized to an arbitrary density matrix. We use these exact expressions to obtain an estimate of the violation of Wick's theorem, and relate it to presence of connected multi-particle initial correlations in the system. We illustrate this new formalism by calculating density and current profiles in many body Fermionic and Bosonic open quantum systems initialized to non-trivial density matrices. We have also shown how this formalism can be extended to interacting many body systems.},

Recently, the emergence of many-body localized systems has questioned this concept and challenged our understanding of the connection between statistical physics and quantum mechanics. Here we report on the observation of a many-body localization transition between thermal and localized phases for bosons in a two-dimensional disordered optical lattice. With our single-site–resolved measurements, we track the relaxation dynamics of an initially prepared out-of-equilibrium density pattern and find strong evidence for a diverging length scale when approaching the localization transition.

The discoveries of these states have sparked the hope of realizing non-trivial excitations and novel effects such as a magnetoelectric effect and topological Majorana excitations. Here we develop a theoretical formalism to show that a three-dimensional topological insulator can be designed artificially via stacking bilayers of two-dimensional Fermi gases with opposite Rashba-type spin-orbit coupling on adjacent layers, and with interlayer quantum tunneling. We demonstrate that in the stack of bilayers grown along a (001)-direction, a non-trivial topological phase transition occurs above a critical number of Rashba bilayers. In the topological phase, we find the formation of a single spin-polarized Dirac cone at the -point. This approach offers an accessible way to design artificial topological insulators in a set up that takes full advantage of the atomic layer deposition approach. This design principle is tunable and also allows us to bypass limitations imposed by bulk crystal geometry.},

  abstract = {Topological insulators are electronic materials that have a bulk band gap like an ordinary insulator but have protected conducting states on their edge or surface. These states are possible due to the combination of spin-orbit interactions and time-reversal symmetry. The two-dimensional (2D) topological insulator is a quantum spin Hall insulator, which is a close cousin of the integer quantum Hall state. A three-dimensional (3D) topological insulator supports novel spin-polarized 2D Dirac fermions on its surface. In this Colloquium the theoretical foundation for topological insulators and superconductors is reviewed and recent experiments are described in which the signatures of topological insulators have been observed. Transport experiments on HgTe∕CdTe quantum wells are described that demonstrate the existence of the edge states predicted for the quantum spin Hall insulator. Experiments on Bi1−xSbx, Bi2Se3, Bi2Te3, and Sb2Te3 are then discussed that establish these materials as 3D topological insulators and directly probe the topology of their surface states. Exotic states are described that can occur at the surface of a 3D topological insulator due to an induced energy gap. A magnetic gap leads to a novel quantum Hall state that gives rise to a topological magnetoelectric effect. A superconducting energy gap leads to a state that supports Majorana fermions and may provide a new venue for realizing proposals for topological quantum computation. Prospects for observing these exotic states are also discussed, as well as other potential device applications of topological insulators.},

  abstract = {Spin-orbit coupling describes the interaction between a quantum particle's spin and its momentum, and is important for many areas of physics from spintronics to the quantum spin Hall effect and topological insulators. However, in systems of ultracold neutral atoms, there is no coupling between the spin and the centre-of-mass motion of the atom. Lin et al. use lasers to engineer such spin-orbit coupling in a neutral atomic Bose–Einstein condensate, the first time this has been achieved for any bosonic system. This should lead to the realization of topological insulators in fermionic neutral atom systems.},

  abstract = {Competition between superconductivity and disorder plays an essential role in understanding the metal-insulator transition. Based on the Bogoliubov-de Gennes framework, we studied an 2D s-wave fermionic optical lattice system with both spin- orbit coupling and disorder are presented. We find that, with the increase of the strength of disorder, the mean superconducting order parameter will vanish while the energy gap will persist, which indicates that the system undergoes a transition from a superconducting state to a gapped insulating state. This can be confirmed by calculating the inverse participation ratio. We also find that, if the strength of disorder is small, the superconducting order parameter and the energy gap will decrease if we increase the strength of spin-orbit coupling and Zeeman field. In the large disorder limits, the increase of the strength of spin- orbit coupling will increase the mean superconducting order parameter. This phenomenon shows that the system is more insensitive to disorder if the spin-orbit coupling is presented. Numerical computing also shows that the whole system breaks up into several superconducting islands instead of being superconductive.},

  abstract = {In the presence of disorder, an interacting closed quantum system can undergo many-body localization (MBL) and fail to thermalize. However, over long times, even weak couplings to any thermal environment will necessarily thermalize the system and erase all signatures of MBL. This presents a challenge for experimental investigations of MBL since no realistic system can ever be fully closed. In this work, we experimentally explore the thermalization dynamics of a localized system in the presence of controlled dissipation. Specifically, we find that photon scattering results in a stretched exponential decay of an initial density pattern with a rate that depends linearly on the scattering rate. We find that the resulting susceptibility increases significantly close to the phase transition point. In this regime, which is inaccessible to current numerical studies, we also find a strong dependence on interactions. Our work provides a basis for systematic studies of MBL in open systems and opens a route towards extrapolation of closed-system properties from experiments.},

The measurement of the supercurrent through the junction allows one to discern topologically distinct phases and observe a topological phase transition by simply changing the in-plane magnetic field or the gate voltage. The observation of this phase transition will be a direct demonstration of the existence of Majorana particles.},

We experimentally observed this nonergodic evolution for interacting fermions in a one-dimensional quasirandom optical lattice and identified the MBL transition through the relaxation dynamics of an initially prepared charge density wave. For sufficiently weak disorder, the time evolution appears ergodic and thermalizing, erasing all initial ordering, whereas above a critical disorder strength, a substantial portion of the initial ordering persists. The critical disorder value shows a distinctive dependence on the interaction strength, which is in agreement with numerical simulations. Our experiment paves the way to further detailed studies of MBL, such as in noncorrelated disorder or higher dimensions.},

This is studied by developing a tight-binding model in the presence of a uniform perpendicular electric field and spin-orbit coupling. We argue that for valence electrons, the spin-orbit coupling strength scales only as the square of the atomic number. The electric field distorts the d orbitals through the admixture of p and f states and also introduces intersite overlap parameters. Expressions for Rashba coefficients for the bands are obtained in both weak and strong spin-orbit interaction limits and are shown to be orbital dependent. The results are compared with first-principles calculations for model systems, showing good agreement. Our study demonstrates the orbital-dependent gate control of the Rashba effect for the purposes of oxide electronics.},
