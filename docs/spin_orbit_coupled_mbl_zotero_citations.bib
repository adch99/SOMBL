Asymptotic forms are obtained for the scaling function β(G)=dlnGdlnL, valid for both G≪Gc≃e2ℏ and G≫Gc. In three dimensions, Gc is an unstable fixed point. In two dimensions, there is no true metallic behavior; the conductance crosses over smoothly from logarithmic or slower to exponential decrease with L., This article appears in the following collection:},

  abstract = {We study the dynamics of one- and two-dimensional disordered lattice bosons/fermions initialized to a Fock state with 1 particle on a set of lattice sites (A) and 0 particles on the rest of the sites (¯¯¯A). Such states have been considered in recent ultracold atomic experiments to detect many body localization. For noninteracting systems we establish a universal relation between the long time density imbalance between A and ¯¯¯A sites, I(∞), the localization length ξl, and the geometry of the initial pattern. For the alternating initial pattern of 1 and 0 particles in one dimension, I(∞)=tanh[a/ξl], where a is the lattice spacing. For systems with mobility edge, we find analytic relations between I(∞), the effective localization length ¯ξl, and the fraction of localized states fl. The imbalance as a function of disorder shows nonanalytic behavior when the mobility edge passes through a band edge. For interacting bosonic systems, we show that there is a mechanism to retain a finite long-time imbalance in the system even in presence of dissipative and stochastic processes coming from interparticle scattering. The scattering of particles, which lead to a decay of the memory of initial conditions through dissipative processes, also creates excitations in the system. For strong disorder, the excitations act as a local bath, whose noise correlators retain information of the initial pattern. This sustains a finite imbalance at long times in strongly disordered interacting systems.},

  abstract = {Competition between superconductivity and disorder plays an essential role in understanding the metal-insulator transition. Based on the Bogoliubov-de Gennes framework, we studied an 2D s-wave fermionic optical lattice system with both spin- orbit coupling and disorder are presented. We find that, with the increase of the strength of disorder, the mean superconducting order parameter will vanish while the energy gap will persist, which indicates that the system undergoes a transition from a superconducting state to a gapped insulating state. This can be confirmed by calculating the inverse participation ratio. We also find that, if the strength of disorder is small, the superconducting order parameter and the energy gap will decrease if we increase the strength of spin-orbit coupling and Zeeman field. In the large disorder limits, the increase of the strength of spin- orbit coupling will increase the mean superconducting order parameter. This phenomenon shows that the system is more insensitive to disorder if the spin-orbit coupling is presented. Numerical computing also shows that the whole system breaks up into several superconducting islands instead of being superconductive.},
