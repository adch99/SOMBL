  abstract = {This paper presents a simple model for such processes as spin diffusion or conduction in the "impurity band." These processes involve transport in a lattice which is in some sense random, and in them diffusion is expected to take place via quantum jumps between localized sites. In this simple model the essential randomness is introduced by requiring the energy to vary randomly from site to site. It is shown that at low enough densities no diffusion at all can take place, and the criteria for transport to occur are given.},

It is shown that the appropriate scaling variable is f(ρ)=ln(1+ρ) where ρ is the dimensionless resistance, which has the property of "additive mean," and that scaling leads to a well-behaved probability distribution of this variable and to a very simple scaling law not previously given in the literature., This article appears in the following collection:},

Experimentally, localization has been reported for light waves, microwaves, sound waves and electron gases, but there has been no direct observation of AL for matter waves of any type. The paper reports AL in a Bose–Einstein condensate as it expands in a one-dimensional disordered optical potential. The authors image directly the atomic density profiles as a function of time, and find that weak disorder can stop the expansion and lead to the formation of a stationary exponentially localized wave function — a direct signature of AL. The method can be extended to localization of atomic quantum gases in higher dimensions, and with controlled interactions.},

  abstract = {The realization that electron localization in disordered systems1 (Anderson localization) is ultimately a wave phenomenon2,3 has led to the suggestion that photons could be similarly localized by disorder3. This conjecture attracted wide interest because the differences between photons and electrons—in their interactions, spin statistics, and methods of injection and detection—may open a new realm of optical and microwave phenomena, and allow a detailed study of the Anderson localization transition undisturbed by the Coulomb interaction. To date, claims of three-dimensional photon localization have been based on observations of the exponential decay of the electromagnetic wave4,5,6,7,8 as it propagates through the disordered medium. But these reports have come under close scrutiny because of the possibility that the decay observed may be due to residual absorption9,10,11, and because absorption itself may suppress localization3. Here we show that the extent of photon localization can be determined by a different approach—measurement of the relative size of fluctuations of certain transmission quantities. The variance of relative fluctuations accurately reflects the extent of localization, even in the presence of absorption. Using this approach, we demonstrate photon localization in both weakly and strongly scattering quasi-one-dimensional dielectric samples and in periodic metallic wire meshes containing metallic scatterers, while ruling it out in three-dimensional mixtures of aluminium spheres.},

  abstract = {We study the dynamics of one- and two-dimensional disordered lattice bosons/fermions initialized to a Fock state with 1 particle on a set of lattice sites (A) and 0 particles on the rest of the sites (¯¯¯A). Such states have been considered in recent ultracold atomic experiments to detect many body localization. For noninteracting systems we establish a universal relation between the long time density imbalance between A and ¯¯¯A sites, I(∞), the localization length ξl, and the geometry of the initial pattern. For the alternating initial pattern of 1 and 0 particles in one dimension, I(∞)=tanh[a/ξl], where a is the lattice spacing. For systems with mobility edge, we find analytic relations between I(∞), the effective localization length ¯ξl, and the fraction of localized states fl. The imbalance as a function of disorder shows nonanalytic behavior when the mobility edge passes through a band edge. For interacting bosonic systems, we show that there is a mechanism to retain a finite long-time imbalance in the system even in presence of dissipative and stochastic processes coming from interparticle scattering. The scattering of particles, which lead to a decay of the memory of initial conditions through dissipative processes, also creates excitations in the system. For strong disorder, the excitations act as a local bath, whose noise correlators retain information of the initial pattern. This sustains a finite imbalance at long times in strongly disordered interacting systems.},

In particular, we consider in detail a class of slowly varying potential with a typical example being Vn=λ cos(παnν) with 0{$<$}ν{$<$}1. We develop an asymptotic semiclassical technique to calculate exactly (in the large-n limit) the density of states and the Lyapunov exponent for this model. We also carry out numerical work involving direct diagonalization and recursive transfer-matrix calculations to study localization properties of the model. Our theoretical results are essentially in exact agreement with the numerical results. Our most important finding is that, for λ{$<$}2, there is a metal-insulator transition in this one-dimensional model (ν{$<$}1) with the mobility edges located at energies Ec=±‖2-λ‖. Eigenstates at the band center (‖E‖{$<$}‖Ec‖) are all extended whereas the band-edge states (‖E‖{$>$}‖Ec‖) are all localized. Another interesting finding is that, in contrast to higher-dimensional random-disorder situations, the density of states, D(E), in this model is not necessarily smooth through the mobility edge, but may diverge according to D(E)∼‖E-Ec∥−δ. The Lyapunov exponent γ (or, the inverse localization length) behaves at Ec as γ(E)∼‖E-Ec∥β, with β=1-δ. We solve the exact critical behavior of the general model, deriving analytic expressions for D(E), γ(E), and the exponents δ and β. We find that λ, α, and ν are all irrelevant variables in the renormalization-group sense for the localization critical properties of the model. We also give detailed numerical results for a number of different forms of Vn.},

We introduce the typical density of states as an order parameter for localization in quasiperiodic systems. By direct calculations of the inverse participation ratio and the typical density of states we numerically verify that this self-dual line indeed defines a mobility edge in energy separating localized and extended states. Our model is a first example of a nearest neighbor tight binding model manifesting a mobility edge protected by a duality symmetry.

Numerical simulations for small system sizes demonstrate how the magnetization and twist overlap, which can be easily obtained from the measurement of qubits in a quantum device, change from the thermal to the localized phases. The twist overlap evaluated with the wave function at the end of time evolution behaves similar to the one evaluated with eigenstates in the middle of energy spectra. The twist overlap, evaluated with the wave function after time evolution for many disorder realizations, will be a promising probe for detecting MBL in quantum-computing approaches.},

  abstract = {We study the transition from a many-body localized phase to an ergodic phase in spin chain with correlated random magnetic fields. Using multiple statistical measures like gap statistics and extremal entanglement spectrum distributions, we find the phase diagram in the disorder-correlation plane, where the transition happens at progressively larger values of the correlation with increasing values of disorder. We then show that one can use the average of sample variance of magnetic fields as a single parameter which encodes the effects of the correlated disorder. The distributions and averages of various statistics collapse into a single curve as a function of this parameter. This also allows us to analytically calculate the phase diagram in the disorder-correlation plane.},

  abstract = {Anderson localization is one of the most interesting phenomena in solid-state physics: it predicts that an electron is immobilized when placed in a disordered lattice. Developed by Phillip Anderson in 1958 to explain how crystals stop conducting and become insulators (answer, when the density of defects in them increases), the model has been used for decades to account for electronic properties of solid-state structures. Yet true Anderson localization effects have not been observed in atomic crystals, as they tend to deviate from the model picture of a periodic potential with fluctuations frozen in time. Now new work carried out at the Haifa Technion confirms localization effects in a true Anderson lattice of a perturbed periodic potential, by using a photonic lattice on which random fluctuations are imposed. These findings raise intriguing questions about the fundamental nature of the interplay between disorder and nonlinearity.},

  abstract = {Anderson localization is a universal phenomenon affecting non-interacting quantum particles in a disordered environment. In three spatial dimensions, theory predicts a quantum phase transition from localization to diffusion at a critical energy, the mobility edge, which depends on the disorder strength. Although it has been recognized already long ago as a prominent feature of disordered systems, a complete experimental characterization of the mobility edge is still missing. Here we report the measurement of the mobility edge for ultracold atoms in a disordered potential created by laser speckles. We are able to control both the disorder strength and the energy of the system, so as to probe the position of the localization threshold in the disorder–energy plane. Our results might allow a direct experiment–theory comparison, which is a prerequisite to study the even more challenging problem of disorder and interactions.},

  abstract = {The transition from diffusive transport to localization of waves should occur for any type of classical or quantum wave in any media as long as the wavelength becomes comparable to the transport mean free path ℓ∗. The signatures of localization and those of absorption, or bound states, can, however, be similar, such that an unequivocal proof of the existence of wave localization in disordered bulk materials is still lacking. Here we present time resolved measurements of light transport through strongly scattering samples with kℓ∗ values as low as 2.5. In transmission, we observe deviations from diffusion which cannot be explained by absorption, sample geometry, or reduction in transport velocity. Furthermore, the deviations from classical diffusion increase strongly with decreasing ℓ∗ as expected for a phase transition. This constitutes an experimental realization of the critical regime in the approach to Anderson localization.},

  abstract = {Among the unusual transport properties predicted for disordered materials is the Anderson localization1 phenomenon. This is a disorder-induced phase transition in the electron-transport behaviour from the classical diffusion regime, in which the well-known Ohm's law holds, to a localized state in which the material behaves as an insulator. The effect finds its origin in the interference of electrons that have undergone multiple scattering by defects in the solid2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10. A similar phenomenon is anticipated for multiple scattering of electromagnetic waves, but with one important simplification: unlike electrons, photons do not interact with one another. This makes transport of photons in disordered materials an ideal model system in which to study Anderson localization10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17. Here we report direct experimental evidence for Anderson localization of light in optical experiments performed on very strongly scattering semiconductor powders.},
